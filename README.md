## My process

Started with html then used internal css styles and then copied it to externl one by adding css link to it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about many css properties and how to use them with html tags.

```html
<h1>Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum</h1>
```

```css
.button:hover {
  cursor: grab;
  background-color: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
}
.button:focus {
  background-color: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
}
```

### Continued development

I would be knowing learning more about css flex-box. And properties inside it. So that I can make my pages more responsive.

I would try to add logic to my pages with help of JS and React.

I am totally a newbie in writing code. My code is improved but still not so clean. I would be working on this area by writing the code in systematic manner.

### Useful resources
